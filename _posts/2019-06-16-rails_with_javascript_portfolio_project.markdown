For this project, I went back to my Rails Travel Journal and added JavaScript to implement dynamic features. Now that I'm done, the index page for trips and show page for each trip can be rendered without refreshing the page, and a user can submit a new location and have it added to the page without refreshing.

In some ways, starting out with JavaScript felt a lot like being back in beginning Ruby...lots of "fumbling" and lots of syntax errors! I'm interested in user experience so, conceptually, I understood what JavaScript was for and why its important, but the syntax took a lot of work to get right. Completing this project really made me appreciate the simplicity of writing Ruby! 

I also needed plenty of time to figure out *how* to debug my project before I could actually *do* the debugging. I remember the use of binding.pry seeming really foreign to me as I started Ruby, but by the time I completed my portfolio project in Rails I felt really comfortable using it to figure out how my code was working. A really important part of JavaScript was taking the time to learn how to use Chrometools and breakpoints to dive in to the code.
