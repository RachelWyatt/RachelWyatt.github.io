**The short answer:**
 I want to work in User Experience/Interaction Design, and I think learning to code will strengthen my graduate school application and make me a more well-rounded job applicant when the time comes. Also, I like understanding how things work.
 
**The long answer:**
In college, I took a class on Young Adult fiction. The class was discussing two different book cover designs. Professor M, as I’ll call her, was telling us about her teenage son. 
            “You know, I set this one out on our kitchen table, left it there for three days—I don’t even think he looked twice,” she said. “I’ll put the other one out next and watch what he does.” She paused, possibly noticing the strange way her students were looking at her. “What? Are you telling me you’ve never left a book out on purpose just to watch how someone would react to it? Sometimes I go in bookstores and just watch people pick out books. Sometimes I pull my *own* books off the shelves and place them conspicuously to see if my target audience is actually picking up my books.”
    I had not, in fact, done any of those things, but I wanted to. Listening to her, and my subsequent work as Editor-in-Chief at my school’s literary journal, made me realize that it wasn’t just the writing in books that captivates people. Writing is a big part, but then there’s the cover, the inside jacket, the size of the book, the price of the book, the book’s location on the shelf, etc...all these properties that can be designed to enhance the chances a book will reach someone.
 
And when I say *reach*, Mr. C.S. Lewis explains it better than I ever will:
 
>             Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another:
>                         ‘What? You too? I thought I was the only one!
 
The reason I love writing is that I want to provide that moment of connection to other people. To reach them. Through the things I create, I want those moments of “What? You too?” or “Oh! I understand now.” I’m naturally a very introverted person, as well as someone who takes a long time to think about things, so these moments happen most frequently for me through processes like reading or writing or, say, having a menu of all possible selections that I can look at and think through before I make a choice. Or using an app that can connect me to people with similar interests. Or having time to refactor code so that the next person who comes along can easily edit it.

So what I’ve loved doing all along, and what I want to continue to learn to do with coding, is design for people. How do people work, and how can we design our world so it benefits them? I’m particularly interested in healthcare and education; I think those are the most impactful resources to connect people to. 

The world is full of great ideas and resources, but those things need to be accessible to be helpful--to reach someone, and let them know they’re not alone--and I hope that by learning software development I can better equip myself to be a good force for change.
