I recently finished my CLI project and, throughout the process, I’ve been reminded a lot about what I learned in my Creative Writing classes at school. A lot of people ask what you learn as a Creative Writing major, and I think the following lessons helped me get through this project and other pieces of life that seem unconquerable:

1. **Start.** Without words there isn’t a book, and without code there isn’t a program. Ideation is an important part of the project, but the writing is absolutely vital and also absolutely terrifying. “Writer’s block” has become a common phrase for a reason. When I sit down to write a story, I get over this by giving myself permission to write imperfectly, and I did the same with my code--my first goal was to get things working and then to worry about elegance and understandability. Stephen King put it well in *On Writing* when he says, “The scariest moment is always just before you start.”
2. **Rewriting and Editing is essential to good writing (even when that writing is code).** Another quote on writing that I love is by Justice Louis Brandeis, who says:“There is no great writing, only great rewriting.” Writing gets down the skeleton of what we want, the basic functionality, whether that is outlining how two characters meet or building out a file structure. Once I can see where I’m going, it's easier to backtrack and make the path more clear by rewriting and editing. This is similar to the first point in that I had to learn to let go and accept not everything will be perfect the first time around.
3. **Come back to it every day.** Even if you don’t feel like it. Even if you only have 15 minutes. Even if all you do is review what you did yesterday. Probably the best writing advice I’ve ever heard is “write every day,” and that same idea applies to coding. Creating a habit makes it easier to come back to, and slowly builds up a project. 
4. **Have an open mind when it comes to rewriting and editing.** I haven’t done my project review yet, but I feel well prepared from doing workshops as an undergraduate. It was hard and scary to give my creative writing to peers and open it up for comments--when something is so personal, comments and ideas can easily feel like criticism. Thankfully, I’ve had the experience of seeing my writing improve because I kept an open mind and listened to comments. An outside pair of eyes is always helpful, and I know I’ll learn a lot during the project review.

This project was an excellent chance to display what I’ve learned so far about Ruby, but I think most importantly this project was a chance to learn how to do a project: how to set up goals, manage time, and deal with frustrations to get to the end line. I’m excited to keep learning and to use what I’ve learned in this project on my second portfolio project!
