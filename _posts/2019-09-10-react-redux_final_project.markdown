I love everything about public libraries except that, after finishing a book, I don’t get the satisfaction of seeing it lined up on a bookshelf--which was my inspiration for my final Flatiron school portfolio project. Built using a Rails back end and a React and Redux front end, I can create different bookcases and add books to them that will be displayed in a virtual “bookshelf” format.
The biggest challenge for me was getting the React-Redux state flow nailed into my head. Pretty early on in learning React, the need for something like Redux became clear to me--passing around state can get confusing as soon as an application begins to grow. Redux provides a solution to this problem by storing all state information in a JavaScript Object (or “POJO” - plain old JavaScript Object ) that can be accessed from anywhere in an application. The idea of Redux is really exciting, but there’s a lot of new vocabulary to learn.
For me, looking at visual representations of the React-Redux flow, like the one below, was the most helpful.

 I also found the console logging exercise in this instructional video to be really helpful. Console logging feels very familiar to me by this point, so I think it helped solidify these ideas, and seeing the step-by-step helped me nail down what was really happening.
